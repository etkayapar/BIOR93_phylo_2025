# Assignment

Add your name to one of the rows in this spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VYY7-ZHgKt1sSojdA3Fv1WBcGX6WjfPnGcKyXUKZD2o/edit#gid=356692471). The genes marked in the row next to your name are the ones you need to analyse for the assignment.


**Assignment** You need to make a concatenated dataset of the 4 genes that have been assigned to you, along with a gene partition file (as you did in [Tutorial 2](../Tutorials/Alignments)), then analyse this dataset in IQ-TREE (as you did in [Tutorial 5](../Tutorials/MaximumLikelihood)).

Make a short report including the resulting tree from the four genes assigned to you as well as the tree from Tutorial 5. Please also send the alignment as a phylip file. Your trees should have nodal support shown. In your report also answer the following three questions.

1) How does the alignment for the rRNA gene (12s is an rRNA mitochondrial gene) looks compared to the protein-coding genes in your dataset?

2) Are there any differences between the tree based on your four genes compared to the tree you inferred in Tutorial 5? 

If there are differences in topology, illustrate them in the trees using FigTree as described in [Tutorial 7](../Tutorials/TreeManipulation) so that you use the same colour for the same clades in the two different trees and in one short paragraph describe these differences.

If you have any questions about the assignment, feel free to email us.

The report is due on Friday, May 30 by midnight, and it is being graded on the pass/fail scale. You can send it by email directly (jadranka.rota@biol.lu.se) or through Canvas.
